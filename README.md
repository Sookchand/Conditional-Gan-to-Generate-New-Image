#  Conditional Gan to Generate New Image
Develop a CGAN with deep CNN for generating new Cifar10 images. The most important difference between GAN and CGAN lies in whether the
labels are used as model input. CGAN takes both the input images/noise and labels as model
input to specify the generated images. That is to say, you can use input noise and specific
labels to generate images in a specific class.
## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank the TensorFlow and Keras teams for providing the tools to build and train the Conditional GAN model. I would also like to thank the authors of the paper “Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets” for providing the theoretical background for this project.

## Demo

- Breadth-First Search (FIFO): The route is [1, 6, 5], and total cost is 23.
- Depth-First Search (LIFO): The route is [1, 6, 5], and total cost is 23.
- Uniform-Cost Search: The route is [1, 3, 6, 5], and total cost is 20.
